# Giggles

We all know how much kids love to play with toys. What is the first thing that comes to mind when we see a kid crying? To put a toy in their hand.

However, children get bored of the same toys quickly, and nowadays, toys are getting less affordable.

Moreover, according to behavior and development studies, fewer toys create less distraction in children, resulting in better learning.

This is where we come in. We, here at Giggles, intend to jump into this opportunity area and do something unique.

Giggles is an expanding and vibrant online marketplace where people can not only buy preloved toys but sell their unused toys at excellent value. It reduces clutter, curtails waste, and helps make toys affordable through circularity, and hence bridges the economic divide created by toys.

This app aims to bring the parenting community closer together and make parenting the great experience it should be by including some parent-centered functionalities.

Other than that, by enabling kids to earn, save, spend on their toys, and get rewarded for good behavior, giggles also aim to teach the value of hard-working and introduce kids to financial literacy at an early age while building good habits that sustain them over their lifetime.

## Technical Aspects

### App
* This app is made in SwiftUI
* The app was made taking iPhone 13 Pro Max in to account and the app was only preview on that iPhone 
  * We were not able to preview that app on other iPhones as the we didn't had that on hand
  * In later stages we will add GeometricReader to get the layout right for any device
* Some of the screen are Placeholders due to the time constraints
  
### Smart Contract
* We have made smart contracts to store the seller's and buyer's information in the blockchain to enhance the privacy of the user in solidity
* For our testing purposes we were using the MetaMask Wallet and Rinkeby Test Network blockchain
* Compute Units are provided by alchemy
* We used https://rinkebyfaucet.com/ to get test ETH
* The integration of contract and SwiftUI is not fully done
